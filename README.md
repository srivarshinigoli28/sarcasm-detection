# Sarcasm Detector

A Deep Learning-based Sarcasm Detection Model using LSTM. This project can predict if a given text is sarcastic or not.  
The model was trained using a dataset containing sarcastic and non-sarcastic comments.  
An LSTM-based neural network was used for classification.  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow  
- Keras  
- Numpy  
- Flask (for web interface)  

## Process
- Install dependencies using:  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
- Clone the repository:
  ```git
  git clone https://github.com/srivarshinigoli28/sarcasm-detector.git
  cd sarcasm-detector
  
- Run the detection script:
  ```python
  python sarcasm_detector.py
Now you can enter your message when prompted to check if it's sarcastic or not.

## Future Improvements
- Improving the model's accuracy with better data preprocessing.
- Deploying a web interface for user interaction.
- Expanding the dataset for improved generalization.
